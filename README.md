## My Infinity Is Bigger Than Your Infinity

[Live Page](https://aldahir15.github.io/MyInfinityIsBiggerThanYours/index.html#/)

### Background and Overview

My Infinity Is Bigger Than Your Infinity is a visual demo/ tutorial of Cantor's Diagonal Argument regarding set theory.
This application explores the concepts of sets, cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, and countable/uncountable sets.

Users will have to answer questions (or have to click on an "Answer Me" button to have it solved if stuck) to proceed for a better understanding. At the end the user will be able to create a list of decimal numbers to try their hands at the Diagonal Argument on their own.

### Technologies
For this application I used ReactJS and vanilla JavaScript to modify and create html code. The libraries used were ReactTypist and Anime.js.

### Tutorial
This application has a tutorial of some basic Set Theory concepts:
- Cardinality
- One-to-one correspondence
- Countability

This tutorial was made in order to visualize Cantor's Diagonal Argument.

### Demo
The Demo has three buttons,
- Random Set: Makes a random set for you to play with.
- Reset: To clear the set.
- Find a New Number: To create a new number based on the diagonal.
