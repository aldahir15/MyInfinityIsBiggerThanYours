## My Infinity Is Bigger Than Your Infinity

### Background and Overview

My Infinity Is Bigger Than Your Infinity is a visual demo/ tutorial of Cantor's Diagonal Argument regarding set theory.
This application explores the concepts of sets, cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, and countable/uncountable sets.

Users will have to answer questions (or have to click on an "Answer Me" button to have it solved if stuck) to proceed for a better understanding. At the end the user will be able to create a list of decimal numbers to try their hands at the Diagonal Argument on their own.

### Functionality & MVP   
Users will be able to:
- [ ] Answer questions throughout the experience.
- [ ] Include their own numbers to test out the Diagonal Theorem.

This project will include:
- [ ] A whole presentation about Cantor's Diagonal Argument and concepts of set theory.
- [ ] Animations using Anime.js and Typist for great styling.

### Wireframes
My app will be a single page app with a next button once questions have been answered. The NavBar will include the logo and links to my LinkedIn and About page.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will use the following technologies:

- ReactJS for dealing with states and passing values onto other components.
- Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering the React components.
- Webpack to bundle scripts.
- Anime.js to animate objects and sets.
- Typist to create animations of typing words onto the screen for a better user experience.

### Implementation Timeline

**Over the weekend**:
- [x] Set up project files and finish typing up the contents of the presentation.
- [ ] Create the questions to be used on the application.

**Day 1**
- [ ] Get started on the scripting of the contents and start using technologies listed above.
- [ ] Finish learning Anime.js to be able to animate objects on JavaScript.

**Day 2**
- [ ] Get far on the presentational aspect of the application.
- [ ] Get started on adding the questions to the application, and its edge cases.
- [ ] Work on the Anime.JS animations.

**Day 3**
- [ ] Finish the presentation and get far on the questions.
- [ ] Finish the Anime.JS animations.

**Day 4**
- [ ] Have the application nicely styled.
- [ ] Have the presentation and its animations be done.
- [ ] Finish the Cantor's Argument demo at the end.
